This is a javascript object that works as the same as 
ordinary javascript Date. For example

d = new JalaliDate();

gives persian date time of now. Then d.getFullYear() would
give this persian year and so on. As basic functions of this
object doesn't have limitations, due to
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Persian_Calendar page, 
this object doesn't have any limit as long as Kayyam rules 
are correct!
